# If pipeline.py is run with this config file and a list of files, then it'll ignore

# just passed this config, it'll use this config on the files below.
# If a file path isn't absolute, it must be relative to the directory you are running
# pipeline.py from. Since the file paths in files and directories in this example start
# with the data directory, the pipeline script must be run from the base speechviz
# directory when running with this config. This doesn't apply to scripts (see below).
