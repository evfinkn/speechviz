# Speech Visualization

DESCRIPTION

## Installation

```
git clone https://research-git.uiowa.edu/uiowa-audiology-reu-2022/speechviz.git
cd speechviz
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the server, run
```
npm start
```
and then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

By default, the server listens on port 8080. You can specify a different port by running
```
npm start -- --port=PORT
```
where PORT is the port you want the server to listen on.

To actually display any audio, you need to:
1. Add the audio file to the `public/audio` directory.
2. Add the json file for the waveform (generated by the pipeline) to the `public/waveforms` directory.
3. Add the json file for the segments (generated by the pipeline) to the `public/segments` directory.

For example, for the file `example.mp3`, there should be `public/audio/example.mp3`, `public/waveforms/example-waveform.json`, and `public/segments/example-segments.json`.
